In 2023, the Web3 PH (Web3 Philippines) team aims to establish a Web3-empowered Philippines by developing protocols, programs, and tools to bolster the Web3 ecosystem and its potential in the nation. üöÄ

Web3 Philippines was founded on March 1, 2022, by [Waren Gonzaga](https://github.com/warengonzaga), and later co-founded by [Beau Zabdiel Valoria](https://github.com/Zabbb), [Kristian Quirapas](https://github.com/kquirapas), and [Alleo Indong](https://github.com/aindong). The first Web3 Philippines meetup was held on September 30, 2022, at Draper Startup House Manila, and was sponsored by Likha, thirdweb, and YOYO Holdings. üíñ

## Introduction

Recently, we introduced [Project Matuto](https://blog.web3philippines.org/learn-web3-effortlessly-with-the-matuto-browser-extension), an initiative that simplifies the learning process for users by showcasing Web3 terms and definitions in each new browser tab, making it easier to grasp Web3 concepts. üî•

Interested? You can [download the browser extension](https://github.com/web3phl/matuto#-download) here.

The extension is compatible with major browsers. We plan to add more features as we enhance the project. If you have ideas, or suggestions, or would like to contribute to the project's growth, please [visit the link](https://github.com/web3phl/matuto/discussions/categories/brainstorming) here. All contributions are welcome! üéâ

## The New Direction

We made a difficult decision to allow others to handle the educational efforts while we concentrate our resources on creating a use case for Web3 by developing protocols, programs, and tools. We believe that it's not only important to educate people, but also to provide them with tools that demonstrate real-world applications of Web3. üå±

In our most recent Twitter Space, we discussed our new direction and provided updates on our plans for the coming weeks and months. We highly recommend tuning in and listening to the recorded session. ü§ù
