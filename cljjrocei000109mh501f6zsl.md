## The Idea

Imagine learning something new from the Web3 glossary of terms and definitions with every new tab you open. That's the idea behind the "Matuto" browser extension, which presents bite-sized web3 terms and their definitions every time you start a new browsing session.

## Why Matuto?

We build this learning supplementary tool to help people learn more about web3, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies. According to [Patric Collins](https://youtu.be/umepbfKp5rI?t=680), he said "Repetition is the mother of skills" so by using the Matuto browser extension you'll enhance your skills in Web3 by learning these terms every new tab, every day.

## How Does It Work?

After installing Matuto on your web browser, it becomes the default new tab. This means that every time you open a new tab, the Matuto dashboard will appear, displaying a web3 term and its definition at the center.

The Matuto browser extension enhances your Web3 skills by displaying a term and its definition on every new tab, while also featuring a basic gas tracker on the dashboard.
